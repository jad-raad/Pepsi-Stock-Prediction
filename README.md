This project predicts Pepsi's stock price after the 7 October incident and the subsequent boycotting. Using a machine learning model, we incorporate political factors, such as the Gaza War, into the prediction of future stock prices. The project includes web scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training a Random Forest regression model to evaluate and forecast Pepsi's stock performance.
